A Python particle-in-cell plasma simulation code is developed to model the interaction between a hydrogen plasma target
and a laser impulse. The code is then optimized to demonstrate the possibilities of using a high level programming
language to call low level numerical procedures, thus achieving high computational efficiency. Performance and scaling is analysed.
